# cg_frameworks
(2010) A set of frameworks for several programming languages that allow creating a window and drawing pixels on it.

These frameworks were developed as an assist tool for teaching Computer Graphics concepts to students back when I was a TA in 2010. I'm posting them here so they are not forever lost in a backup drive.

The frameworks are provided for the following programming languages: C, C++, Java, C#, and Python.

For OO languages, the class Canvas provides all the methods necessary to create the window and paint into it. In the case of C, the framework consists in a series of free-floating functions. Please look into canvas.h for more information.

These frameworks are provided as a curiosity. THERE IS NO WARRANTY. NOT EVEN THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MECHANTABILITY OF SUITABILITY FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
